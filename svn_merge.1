.SH NAME
svn_merge - merge changesets from one svn repository to the working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B svn_merge
[-r REVISIONS|--revisions=REVISIONS] [-d DESTINATION|--destination=DESTINATION] [-m|--manual-commit] source_url

.B svn_merge
[-c|--continue] [-a|--abort]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This script does merging using svn merge with multiple
revisions.  For example:

    svn_merge -r1000-1005,1008 http://svnserver/path

will merge revisions 1000-1005 and 1008 from
http://svnserver/path into the current directory.

It merges one revision at a time.  If there's a conflict, the user can resolve
it manually and continue the merge.

---

Reasons for using this script:

    svnmerge also allows merging multiple commits.  svnmerge will
merge all the commits into the current tree and let the user commits
it.  The problem comes when the user merges lots of commits in one
go, losing version history and making "svn ann" useless.

    This script will commit after merging every commit, and commit with the
original message with the original revision number.  So it is possible to use
"svn ann" to find out which commit changed what line and the commit message
with it.

.SH EXAMPLES

Scenario 1: Merging from one tree to another tree

You want to merge changes from one branch into another branch.  For
example, you created a branch from trunk to fix a ticket, now it's
done and you want to merge it back into trunk.

1. Go to the trunk directory

2. Start merging:
   $ svn_merge https://svnserver/branches/trunk_1234

3. Resolve conflicts and continue the merge

4. Resolve conflicts if there are any:
   It'll show a message like: Use "svn commit -F commit_message" to commit
   - Manually edit files to resolve conficts
   - $ svn resolve file1
   - $ svn commit -F commit_message

5. Continue the merge:
   $ svn_merge --continue

-----

Scenario 2: Merging some changesets from one tree to another tree

You want to cherry pick changesets to merge from one tree to another.
For example, you want to get some changesets from "branch" to
"trunk".

1. Go to the trunk directory

2. Select changesets to merge:
   $ svn_merge -r1000-1005,1008 https://svnserver/branches/branch

   Or if your target directory is different from your source directory:
   $ svn_merge -r 1000-1005,1008 -d dir2 https://svnserver/branches/branch/dir

   Or if you want to manually commit the changes:
   $ svn_merge -m https://svnserver/branches/branch
